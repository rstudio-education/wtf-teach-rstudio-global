# Provide instant feedback {#feedback}

![](images/icons8-comments-100.png){.cover} As enrollments in statistics and data science courses grow and as these courses become more computational, educators are faced with an interesting challenge -- providing timely and meaningful feedback, particularly with online delivery of courses.
The simplest solution is using assignments that are easier to auto-grade, e.g. multiple-choice questions, simplistic coding exercises, but it is impossible to assess mastery of the entire data science cycle using only these types of exercises.
In this talk I will discuss writing effective learnr exercises, providing useful and motivating feedback with gradethis, distributing them at scale online and as an R package, and collecting student data for formative assessment with learnrhash.
