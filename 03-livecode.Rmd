# Live code early and often {#livecode}

![](images/icons8-mouse-pointer-100.png){.cover} Think back to your last math heavy course, one with proofs or problems that required multi-step solutions.
Did you prefer to see all steps at once or prefer that the instructor walk through the steps at a reasonable pace, revealed them incrementally, and talked through their reasoning?
I'm guessing the latter.
Live coding is just like that, except with code instead of math.
