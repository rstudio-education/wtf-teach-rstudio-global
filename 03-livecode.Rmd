# Live code early and often {#livecode}

![](images/icons8-mouse-pointer-100.png){.cover} Think back to your last math heavy course, one with proofs or problems that required multi-step solutions.
Did you prefer to see all steps at once or prefer that the instructor walk through the steps at a reasonable pace, revealed them incrementally, and talked through their reasoning?
I'm guessing the latter.
Live coding is just like that, except with code instead of math.
@raj2018 is just one of the many papers that suggests that live coding is the most effective way of teaching programming.
But, of course, just like any effective pedagogy, implementation details matter for learning and enjoyment of your learners.
