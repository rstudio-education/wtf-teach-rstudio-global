-   Pick one person from your breakout room to go to the RStudio Cloud project titled NAME OF RSTUDIO CLOUD PROJECT share their screen. Make the plot in the Rmd document titled `ugly-ggplot2.Rmd` as ugly as you can in the allotted time. This should be a group effort where the person sharing the screen is implementing changes others suggest. The others in the team should also be looking up ggplot2 documentation to help come up with the code that implements those changes.
