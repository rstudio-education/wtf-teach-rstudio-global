# Define and pronounce {#speak}

![](images/icons8-voice-100.png){.cover} What is a floating point?
What is a double?
How do you say `%>%` out loud?
How do you pronounce `POSIXct`? Answers to some of these might seem obvious to you, but may not be obvious to a new learner.

## Your turn

You have 5 minutes for this activity.

1.  Read the following code chunks out loud. As a group, try to come to an agreement on how to pronounce everything you see on the screen.

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)

aggregate(penguins[, 3], list(penguins$species), median, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r message = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)

penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(median_bl = median(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```

2.  Think back to when you first started learning R... What is an R (or general programming) related term that wasn't clear to you but your instructor, book, documentation, etc. assumed familiarity with it?
