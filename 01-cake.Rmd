# Let them eat cake first! {#cake}

![](images/icons8-cake.png){.cover width="100"} Start teaching R with visualisation.
This means jumping over installation details, which we'll discuss in [cherish day one](#dayone) as well as basics of the R syntax.
The "let them eat cake first" approach, where students first see an example of a complex data visualisation, which they will be able to build by the end of the course you're teaching, and then slowly work their way through the building blocks [@çetinkaya-rundel2020].
This approach is also presented in @wang2017data, which advocates for "bringing big ideas into intro stats early and often".

-   **Option 1:** Voting patterns of countries in the UN General Assembly

    -   Start the project titled **01a - UN Votes**.

    -   In the Files pane (bottom right corner), spot the file called `unvotes.Rmd`.

    -   Open it and click "Knit".

    -   Then...

        -   Go back to the file and change your name on top of the document and knit again.
        -   Change the country names to those you're interested in. Spelling and capitalization must match how the countries appear in the data, so take a peek at the Appendix to confirm spelling.
        -   Knit again. Voila, your first data visualization!

-   **Option 2:** COVID-19 fatality numbers across the globe

    -   Start the project titled **01b - COVID-19**.

    -   In the Files pane (bottom right corner), spot the file called `covid.Rmd`.

    -   Open it and click "Knit".

    -   Then...

        -   Go back to the file and change your name on top of the document and knit again.

        -   Change the country names to those you're interested in.
            Spelling and capitalization must match how the countries appear in the data, so take a peek at the Appendix to confirm spelling.

        -   Knit again.
            Voila, your first data visualization!

### Discuss

When you're done with the exercises, discuss with others in your breakout group how you would adapt such an exercise for your teaching.
Which dataset would you use?
Don't worry too much about feasibility (e.g. is such data easily accessible), instead focus on what data/questions audiences you generally teach would be interested in.
