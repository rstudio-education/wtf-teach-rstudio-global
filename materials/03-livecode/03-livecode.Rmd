# Why?

---

## Why livecode?

- Slows you down

--
- Helps you articulate each step

--
- Allows you to demonstrate the order and process

--
- (Most likely) causes you to make errors (that you can turn into teachable moments or use to show everyone makes errors!)

--
- Saves you time

---

## Why not *just* livecode?

- Providing multiple formats to learn from is better than just providing one

--
- Can be hard to follow if you're not careful

--
- Can be difficult to get a permanent record of (though this is less of a problem for virtual teaching)

# What?

---

## Live code or not to live code

Any topic will benefit from a livecoding session, but for some using live coding as the **primary** communication method is more appropriate than others.

--

- Live code first:
  - RStudio IDE
  - Working with Git and GitHub
  - Using R Markdown

--

- Static materials first, live code second:
  - Anything involving a new (to your learners) syntax/API (dplyr, ggplot2, etc.)
  - Anything involving interpreting results
  - etc.

## Live coding in person

- **Keep in mind:**
  - Room size
  - Audience size
  - Your own setup
  
- **Tip:** Don't rely on just the physical screen, use a secondary method to get your code in front of students' eyes (e.g. `r emo::ji("package")` [livecode](https://github.com/rundel/livecode))

---

## Live coding virtually

- **Keep in mind:** Audience watching on smaller devices
  
- **Tip:** If you have a live audience, give them plenty of opportunity and simple tooling to participate (e.g. Zoom chat)

---

## Live coding with strictly limited time

.hand[e.g. meetup presentations, conference talks, etc.]

<br>

**Tip:** Consider pre-recording a screencast that you can narrate during the event

---

## Livecoding tips

- Omit or fully narrate keyboard shortcuts

--
- If need to type passwords, keep "off screen" notes handy that you can copy-paste from

--
- Avoid switching between screens

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/shiny-livecode.jpeg")
```
