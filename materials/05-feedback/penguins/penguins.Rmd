**This is a demo tutorial created for the "What they forgot to teach you about teaching R" workshop. See [here](http://wtf-teach.netlify.app/) for slides and full set of materials from the workshop series.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

```{r stormtrooper, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=3, out.width = "100%", fig.cap="Illustration by Allison Horst."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lter_penguins.png")
```

Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/).

The data are distributed in the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) package.

### Learning goals

-   Practice developing exercises with learnr.
-   Practice writing code checking tests with gradethis.

### Getting help

If you have any questions call for help in Zoom!

### Packages

In this tutorial we will work with the **palmerpenguins** and **tidyverse** packages.
So let's go ahead and load them!

```{r load-package, exercise = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## Multiple choice questions

Modify the following question to:

-   Allow retry for incorrect answers
-   Display answers in a random order
-   Customise the message text for correct answer
-   Customise the message texts for incorrect answers (try giving different pieces of feedback for different incorrect answers)
-   Modify the penguin color question to allow multiple correct answers
-   Place the two questions in a `quiz()`

```{r awesome-penguins}
question(
  "How awesome are penguins?",
  answer("Super awesome!", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Awesome"),
  answer("Meh"),
  answer("Not awesome"),
  answer("Super not awesome")
)
```

```{r penguin-colors}
question(
  "Penguins are which of the following colors?",
  answer("Black", correct = TRUE),
  answer("White"),
  answer("Magenta"),
  answer("Cyan")
)
```

## Code exercises

### Checking for the result

Create a frequency table of the species of penguins on Biscoe island, and display the results in descending order of frequency.

Your task is to add more `fail_if_equal()` statements to the code checking chunk to check for realistic mistakes students can make and give them informative feedback that will nudge them in the right direction.

```{r penguins-count, exercise = TRUE}
penguins %>%
  filter(island __ "Biscoe") %>%
  ___(___)
```

```{r penguins-count-hint-1}
penguins %>%
  filter(island == "Biscoe") %>%
  count(___, ___)
```

```{r penguins-count-hint-2}
Add a hint...
```

```{r penguins-count-solution}
penguins %>%
  filter(island == "Biscoe") %>%
  count(species, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r penguins-count-check}
grade_this({
  pass_if_equal(
    x = as.character(.result[1,2]), 
    y = "124", 
    message = "In this dataset, the most common species of penguins on Biscoe island are Gentoo pengiuns."
  )
  fail_if_equal(
    x = as.character(.result[1,2]), 
    y = "123", 
    message = "Checking for 123 doesn't make sense here, change this to some other realistic check."
  )
  # add more fail_if_equal() statements...
  # and fill in the blank below
  fail("Not quite! ___")
})
```

### Checking for the code

Create a frequency table of the island penguins come from and display the results in descending order of frequency.

```{r penguins-island-count, exercise = TRUE}
penguins %>%
  ___
```

```{r penguins-island-count-hint-1}
penguins %>%
  count(___)
```

```{r penguins-island-count-solution}
penguins %>%
  count(island, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r penguins-island-count-check}
grade_this_code()
```

## Wrap Up & Submit

Congratulations, we hope you enjoyed reviewing what we've learned so far!

```{r context="server"}
learnrhash::encoder_logic()
```

```{r encode, echo=FALSE}
learnrhash::encoder_ui(
  ui_before = div(strong("Submit your hash in the form below."), br(), br()),
  ui_after  = learnrhash::iframe_ui(
    src = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvAYLFXu0Gc-U9FPzWegO6i147ta30cebDWSp5Eni5GXWBgQ/viewform?embedded=true",
    width = "700px", height =  "1000px"
  )
)
```

## Decode demo

The following would not be included in a student facing tutorial, but has been included here to demonstrate the decoding functionality of the [`learnrhash`](https://rundel.github.io/learnrhash/) package.

Paste your hash from the preceding step into the text box below and push the Decode button.
You should then see printed tibbles containing the question and exercise results you have entered into the tutorial so far.
See the package README for details on how these data would be extracted in practice for a real assignment.

```{r context="server"}
learnrhash::decoder_logic()
```

```{r decode, echo=FALSE}
learnrhash::decoder_ui()
```
