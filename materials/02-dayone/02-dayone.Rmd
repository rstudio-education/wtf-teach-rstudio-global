## Which kitchen would you rather bake in?

# Hello RStudio Cloud!

## What is RStudio Cloud?

.pull-left-narrow[
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cloud.png")
```
]
.pull-right-wide[
.large[We created **RStudio Cloud** to make it easy for professionals, hobbyists, trainers, teachers, and students to do, share, teach, and learn data science using R.]

```

## Why RStudio Cloud?

- Does not require IT support
- Features designed for instructors:
  - Classes can be organized in workspaces
  - Members can be assigned different roles: instructor, TA, student
  - Projects can be public or private
  - Projects can be made into assignments 
  - Students can make copies of projects created by instructor
  - Instructor can peek into student projects
  - A base project template can ensure same packages in each new project created in the workspace
  - Git works out of the box

## Sharing an individual project

.pull-left[
.hand[.green[Good!]]

- Students land directly in a project upon login
- Works well for workshops where all work will be completed in a single project
- Also great for sharing code in general, e.g. collaboration, reprexes, etc.
]

.pull-right[
.hand[.pink[Not so good...]]

- Students need to remember to make a copy of the project (which means you need to remember to remind them!)
- Changes you make after student launches the project won’t propagate to their project

## Creating a workspace, instructor view

<iframe width="1200" height="530" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tqu1m9R1HLw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

.right[ .large[ `r emo::ji("woman_teacher")`  ]  ]

## Sharing a workspace

.pull-left[
.hand[.green[Good!]]

- Various permission levels
- Base projects with desired packages installed
- Assignments, which remove the need to remind students to make a copy of the project before starting work
- Ability to peek into students’ projects
]
.pull-right[
.hand[.pink[Not so good...]]

- Students land in the workspace, may need to provide instructions for the next steps
- You can update the base project throughout the course, but it will only be applied to projects created going forward
]

## Tips

- Each project is allocated 1GB of RAM and 1 CPU
  - Test things out before assignments involving large datasets 

- What your students see is not always what you see
  - Create a secondary account and add as a student
